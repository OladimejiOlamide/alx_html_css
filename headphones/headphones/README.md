ALX HTML/CSS Headphones Project

This repository contains the solution for the ALX HTML/CSS project, implementing a responsive web page design based on the provided Figma concept.

Directory: headphones

This directory contains the files for the single-page website:

index.html: The main file containing all HTML structure, inline CSS styles, and accessibility features.

style.css: (Implicitly combined into index.html due to the single-file mandate, but represents the project's styling logic).

Features Implemented

HTML5 Structure: Semantic use of <header>, <main>, <section>, and <footer>.

Custom CSS: Implemented without external CSS frameworks (like Bootstrap or Tailwind).

Responsive Design: Optimized for screens up to 1000px and includes a mobile layout breakpoint at 480px.

Accessibility: Used ARIA attributes, descriptive alt text, and semantic elements.

Interactions:

Links (<a>) hover/active state set to the primary accent color (#FF6565).

Buttons hover/active state set to opacity: 0.9.
